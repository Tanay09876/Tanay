In the realm where right and wrong collide,
Truth and falsehood both reside.
A dance of shadows, a play of light,
Where clarity struggles against the night.

Righteous paths, paved with noble deeds,
Echoes of truth in heartbeats that lead.
Guiding stars in the moral sky,
Illuminate the way, never shy.

Yet darkness lurks in deceit's disguise,
Whispering falsehoods, weaving lies.
Temptations beckon, illusions gleam,
Leading astray from truth's pure stream.

Right and wrong, a delicate line,
Truth and falsehood, intertwined.
Choices made, consequences unfold,
In the tapestry of stories untold.

But in the heart that seeks what's true,
In the mind that discerns the hue,
Righteousness shines, a beacon bright,
Guiding through the shadows of the night.
