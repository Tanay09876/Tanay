In nature's arms, a world divine,
Where beauty and wonder endlessly shine.
Whispers of wind through ancient trees,
A symphony of life, a timeless breeze.

Mountains rise, majestic and tall,
Guardians of secrets, standing tall.
Rivers flow with soothing song,
Carving paths where dreams belong.

Fields of flowers, a rainbow's hue,
Painting landscapes fresh and new.
Birds in flight, melodies pure,
Nature's chorus, ever sure.

Sunset hues, a painter's delight,
Colors merging in the fading light.
Stars above, a celestial dance,
A universe of chance and circumstance.

Nature's rhythm, a heartbeat strong,
Teaching lessons, where we belong.
In her embrace, we find our peace,
A sanctuary where worries cease.

So let us cherish, protect, and care,
For nature's gifts, beyond compare.
In every leaf, in every tree,
Nature's beauty sets us free.
