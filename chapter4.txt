In spring's tender embrace, life awakes anew,
Blossoms bloom, painting fields in hues so true.
The air whispers songs of rebirth and light,
As nature dances in the soft morning's sight.

Summer arrives with warmth and golden rays,
Days stretch long in the sun's fiery blaze.
Fields of green sway in the gentle breeze,
As laughter and joy fill the air with ease.

Autumn's palette paints the world in gold and red,
Leaves fall like confetti, a tapestry spread.
Crisp air carries the scent of harvest and change,
As nature prepares for its slumber, not estrange.

Winter descends with a blanket of snow,
Silence reigns in the stillness, a tranquil glow.
Frost-kissed mornings and cozy nights by the fire,
As we cherish the season's quiet desire.

Each season, a chapter in nature's grand tale,
A cycle of beauty, without fail.
In every turn, a lesson to learn and glean,
As seasons unfold, in their rhythm serene.
