In the cosmic dance of stars so bright,
Where galaxies swirl in the endless night,
There lies a wonder, vast and deep,
A realm of mysteries, ours to keep.

In the velvet cloak of space's embrace,
Planets spin with gentle grace,
Each a jewel in the celestial choir,
Singing songs of eternal fire.

The moon, a silent guardian in the sky,
Watches over with a serene eye,
Reflecting the sun's eternal glow,
A beacon of hope in the dark's shadow.

From distant nebulae to black holes' might,
Space unveils its secrets, infinite and bright,
A canvas of dreams where souls dare to soar,
In the boundless expanse, forevermore.
