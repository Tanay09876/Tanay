In the dance of life and death we twirl,
A cosmic waltz, a swirling whirl.
Life's fleeting moments, bright and bold,
Death's quiet whispers, secrets untold.

In life's embrace, we laugh and cry,
Underneath the same vast sky.
We chase our dreams, we stumble, we rise,
Facing each dawn with hopeful eyes.

Yet death, like a shadow, walks beside,
A constant companion on life's wild ride.
It whispers of endings, of cycles complete,
Of journeys finished, of souls that meet.

Life's joys and sorrows, intertwined,
In the tapestry of fate, beautifully designed.
For in every ending, a new beginning lies,
In every farewell, a promise of sunrise.

So let us cherish each moment we're given,
In the grand symphony, our part, we're livin'.
For life and death, hand in hand,
Are the threads that weave this wondrous land.
